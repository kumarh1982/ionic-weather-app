# ionic-weather-app

My first go at the Ionic Framework and AngularJS.

## Running

1. `bower install` to install *ngCordova* and *moment*
2. `ionic serve` to run the app in the browser

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run it on a proper Android enviroment, not even on the emulator, so it has been tested only on Google Chrome.

## TODO list

- [ ] run on Android
- [ ] add swipe from one city to another in #/tab/weather

## Prints

- Home page (#/tab/home): ![homepage](/images/home.png)
- Cities page (#/tab/cities): ![cities](/images/cities.png)
- Weather page (#/tab/weather): ![weather](/images/weather.png)
