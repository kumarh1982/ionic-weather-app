# ionic-weather-app

My first go at the Ionic Framework and AngularJS.

The relevant code is at [/www](/www), mainly the [js file](/www/js/app.js).

## Running

1. `bower install` to install *ngCordova* and *moment*
2. `ionic serve` to run the app in the browser

Unfortunately, I was able to run it on the Android emulator for only a short period of time (the development was done on Google Chrome). It was run on an Android Virtual Device (AVD) emulating a Nexus 4 and executing Android 4.1.2. The behavior was the same as the one on Google Chrome.

## TODO list

- [X] run on Android
- [ ] add swipe from one city to another in #/tab/weather

## Prints

- Home page (#/tab/home): ![homepage](/images/home.png)
- Cities page (#/tab/cities): ![cities](/images/cities.png)
- Weather page (#/tab/weather): ![weather](/images/weather.png)
